DESCRIPTION:


Identification cards or ID cards are the most important credential for any organization, and it helps uniquely identify the person or verify them. However, these ID cards may contain some personal information like the mobile number or the person’s address. Such crucial information, if fallen into the wrong hands, could be misused. Hence, here we are proposing a system where all the information of the user will be used to generate a QR code and that QR will be embedded in the user’s image such that it will be invisible to the naked eyes. The main aim of our project is to develop a system that will embed the QR code (containing arbitrary user information) into a coloured image (User photograph), such that the QR image will be hidden in the background and the primary visible image will be the user image. We are using the methodology of convolution neural networks and Image-Steganography for developing this system.In our model, we are aiming to use Convolution neural networks to achieve Image Steganography which will consist of two CNNs; encoder CNN and decoder CNN. The role of encoder CNN will be to take an input of the QR code image and colour image and generate an output of coloured image embedded with the QR code image such that the QR image will be undetected by the naked eyes. The role of decoder CNN is to recover the original QR code image from the coloured image.
