Brief Description about Project Implementation:

Women nowadays do not feel safe, either inside or outside of their homes. The crime rate is high, and accidents happen on every other route for various reasons. As a result, we proposed the idea of a safety band to help women and victims in critical situations. Given the circumstances, we devised a method for a woman to obtain administrative assistance on time. The Bluetooth module will help to connect hardware with software. We used a band for hardware and a mobile software application. Our technology will help women who have been sexually harassed, as well as victims of accidents or other crises, by tracking and communicating their real-time location, to the family and the police via ShortMessage Service (SMS) using the Global System forMobile Communications (GSM) module and Global Positioning System (GPS) module while the victim is in the process of being tracked. Our method helps them remember the coordinates of where they pressed the push button. All data will be stored on Firebase and analyzed before reporting to law enforcement and government agencies. Based on the investigationâ€™s findings, the police may take further actions to help the victims.
