# Introduction
  The supply chain of a pharmaceutical entity is the means through which medicines and medical supplies are manufactured and made available to the patients. The traditional Supply Chain of the Healthcare industry involves raw material suppliers who supply raw material to the manufacturers for drug generation, packaging, and supplying to the distributors. The manufacturer maintains an inventory of drugs for smooth operations. The hospital’s pharmacy or a retail pharmacy places an order to a distributor for stocking and restocking their inventory, based on the daily requirement.
  In a healthcare environment, inventory refers to the medications and all the medical supplies used in its daily operation. A healthcare entity is required to ensure an adequate stock of medicines and medical supplies are available at all times to better serve the needs of their patients. An effective inventory management process should also contribute to the profitability of the entity. There are two goals of an efficient inventory management process. The first is to ensure medications are available whenever the patients need them. Optimal efforts should be made to always keep the medications used in stock and restock them before they go out-of-stock or get outdated and damaged. The second goal is to contribute to the overall profitability of the entity. The focus should be on being of service to the patients while also keeping the purchase costs of the medications at a minimum.
  Robotic Process Automation is a business process automation technology that allows an individual or an organization to define a set of instructions for a software robots or ‘bots’ to perform. These bots mimic the way humans interact with software to perform high-volume, repeatable tasks. With the help of RPA, we can automate repetitive tasks such as checking inventory and reordering supplies and decisive processes such as reading and comparing vendor quotations and finalizing a supply vendor. This automation incorporated within the system will make it less prone to errors as well as less time-consuming.
  
Some features of Blue Prism include: 
1) It is platform-independent so that it can be used on any platform. 
2) It contains robust features like load balancing, data encryption, and endto-end auditing. Thus, every change is audited. 
3) 3) Blue Prism also supports automation of codes written in Mainframe, Java, Windows applications, and even web-based applications.
4) It supports all major cloud platforms, like Microsoft Azure and Amazon AWS. So, users can manage most of the tasks centrally.
Some advantages of the RPA include:
1. Cost Savings:- RPA helps organizations to save a huge amount of cost as it is typically cheaper than hiring an employee to perform the same set of tasks.
2. Less Error:- It works on standard logic and does not get bored, distracted, or tired. Hence, the probability of making errors reduces to a great extent, which means less re-work and an enhanced reputation for efficiency.
3. Faster Processing:- It works faster than human employees as computer software does not need breaks, food, rest, etc., and can perform repetitive operations tirelessly.
