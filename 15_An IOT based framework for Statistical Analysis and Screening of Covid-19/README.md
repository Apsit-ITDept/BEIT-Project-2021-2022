# An IOT based framework for Statistical Analysis and Screening of Covid-19

### Team Members:
	Pratik Gholap
	Priyanka Walekar
	Apoorva Gadkari

### Project Description:
	 The Hardware Framework will be used to collect the information on vitals and the data
	generated will be stored in a database where the details of the user will be stored along
	with their device number which will be an ID as identification for the users. A table will be
	created storing results all the results and a link will be generated to see in detail the result
	which will be shown on the website.
	 This data will have to be processed via ML algorithm (SVM algorithm) where the result
	will be shown on an app. A simple interface mobile application is presented after applying
	the algorithm to the data. After the user logs, in this page will direct the user to further
	pages depending upon whether the user is a first-time user or a registered user. Here, the
	registered user will have his/her history of the previous test results if the user has conducted
	any previous test, Current/Latest generated data will be displayed in the form of animated
	meters stuff and a message with a questionnaire that the user has to fill and all this data
	clubbed together will be displayed in the webpage.
	 The webpage will have a support page that will show her the information of the result
	along with a link to show in-depth test results. The website will have four buttons to download
	the data in different formats like CSV, XLS, PDF, etc. for personal use or further
	research study. An email will be used as a communication medium if anyone needs to contact
	me regarding datasets. The website where are all the details are shown will be in a very
	understandable format to help people study the data with the least trouble.
	 The Webpage/Website is not a process for normal user/user. This website will just be
	having the data which can be used only for research purposes.
