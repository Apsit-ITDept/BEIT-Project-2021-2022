# Brief Implementation:
The food industry is expanding every day and it is crucial to maintain the required standards which impact their market value. To maintain these standards, manpower is used which is inconsistent, expensive, and time-consuming. With the help of automation of classification, we can speed up this process with less expensive resources using Computer Vision along with the Internet of Things(IoT). The evolution of the Internet of Things(IoT) has played an important role in making the devices smarter and more connected. The large amount of data collected from these devices can be used for data analysis which helps the industries to plan their future decisions. This project proposes the idea of implementing an infrastructure having a micro-controller that would accurately segregate three kinds of fruits into two categories i.e. Fresh and Rotten.
Detection of defected fruits and the classification of fresh and rotten fruits represent one of the major challenges in the agricultural fields. Rotten fruits may cause damage to the other fresh fruits if not classified properly. Traditionally this classification is done by men, which is labour-intensive, time taking, and not efficient procedure. Thus, factories need human intervention for segregation of fruits.
Hence, we need an automated system which can reduce the efforts of humans and time of production. Our system will automatically do that with help of CNN classification Algorithm. The proposed idea will create a segregation model which would need no human intervention for classifying and segregating fruits.
