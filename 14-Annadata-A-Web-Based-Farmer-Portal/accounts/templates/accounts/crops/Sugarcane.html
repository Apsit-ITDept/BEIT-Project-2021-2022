	<p> Sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.) is the main sources of sugar in India and holds a prominent position as a
		cash crop.
		<br> India is the world’s largest consumer and the second largest producer of sugar, topped only by Brazil.
		Nearly 2.8 lakh farmers have been cultivating sugarcane in the vast area of 4.4 lakh acres and over 11 crore
		people are directly or indirectly dependent on the sugar industry in the country. <br>Sugarcane is one of the
		important commercial crops of India, grown in an area of 3.93 m.ha with annual production of 170 M.T. <br>
		Sugarcane productivity in India is around 67 t/ha. It is one of the most important food-cum-cash crop grown in
		the country, providing employment to a larger number of people, in addition to earning considerable foreign
		exchange.
	</p>

	<h2 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">
		Requirement</h2>

	<h2 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">
		Climate</h2>
	Sugarcane is able to grow over a prolonged season. Under warm humid conditions, it can continue its growth, unless
	terminated by flowering. Temperatures above 50o C arrest its growth; those below 20 o C slow it down markedly and
	severe frost proves fatal. <br>The crop does best in the tropical regions receiving a rainfall of 750-1200mm. For
	ripening, it needs a cool, dry season; but where rainfall is too heavy and prolonged, the quality of the juice tends
	to be low, and where the weather remains comparatively.

	<h2 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">
		Soil</h2>
	Sugarcane grows best on medium heavy soils, but can also be raised on lighter soils and heavy clays, provided there
	is adequate irrigation available in the former type of soils and drainage is good in the latter type of soils.
	<br>In many places, dark rich clay loams, 120-150cm deep, and lying on a previous substratum of murum
	(distintegrated traprock) ae used for this crop. In some areas.

	<h2 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">
		Varieties</h2>

	CO – 419, CO – 740, CO – 7219 (Sanjivini), CO.M – 7125, CO – 7527, CO.M – 88121(7714), CO –8014 (Mahalaxmi), CO –
	86032 (Nira), CO.C – 671, CO.C – 85061, CO - 8011, CO.M. – 7114, CO.S.I – 776,

	<h2 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">
		Planting</h2>

	<h2 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">
		Seed treatment</h2>
	The availability of good quality cane seed materials (setts) from a nursery crop of 10-11 months are essential for
	better germination and good growth.<br> The treatments included were namely control, 0.05% Bavistin, 2.5% Urea, 2.5%
	KCI, 2.5% KCI+Urea, 1% Hadron. Two budded setts were used for planting after treating with above chemicals. Also hot
	water treatment is given to prevent seed borne diseases.

	<h2 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">Sowing</h2>
	Planting of sugarcane is done in three seasons that is suru- January-February, adsali - July-August and pre
	seasonal- October-November for planting generally ridges and furrows are prepared on 100-120cm spacing. For planting
	one hectare area 25-30 thousand three eye buded cane setts are required.

	<h2 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">Fertilizers</h2>
	<p>Adequate manuring is essential for sustained high yields. The general recommendation in most places is to apply
		half to two-thirds of the nitrogen in the form of bulky organic manures, such as farmyard manure, compost, green
		manure or tree leaves, and the remainder in the form of ammonium sulphate or oil-cakes or a combination of the
		two.<br> For sugarcane fertilizer is recommended according to planting season and it is varied from growing
		tract to tract. In general for suru sugarcane 250:115:115 for Adsali 400:170:170 and for pre seasonal
		340:170:170 kg nitrogen, phosphorus and potash per hectare is recommended respectively. For ratooning
		250:115:115kg nitrogen, phosphorus and potash per hectare is recommended.</p>

	<h2 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">Irrigation</h2>
	<p>Water requirement of sugarcane varies from 2000 to 2500 mm depending upon its duration, soil type and
		climatological factors. For sugarcane germination, tillering, grand growth and maturity are the critical stages
		for irrigation.<br> During germination phase (1-35 days) there should be enough moisture in the soil for better
		germination but waterlogging is undesirable as it leads to rotting of setts. During this period irrigation can
		be scheduled at weekly intervals. But irrigation at 10 days interval during tillering stage (36-100 days) is
		sufficient.<br> The formative and grand growth stages (101-270 days) are the critical stages for water demand.
		During this period irrigation can be practised at weekly intervals. At the maturity phase (271 days to harvest)
		fortnightly irrigation is enough. Irrigation will have to be stopped at 15 days prior to harvest.</p>

	<h2 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">
		Intercultural operations</h2>

	<h2 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">
		Mulching</h2>
	<p>In early days, application of paddy straw or spreading of sugarcane trash in the field will decrease the
		evaporation and thus decrease the water demand of the crop besides improving the yield.</p>

	<h2 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">
		Hoeing and earthing-up</h2>
	<p>The first hoeing an weeding should be given to the crop three to four weeks after planting. After germination,
		depending on the field conditions and the frequency of irrigation, two or three more hoeings and weedings may be
		required during the first three months after planting with the coming up of the crop.<br> The final earthing-up
		should be completed before the monsoon rains, and should generally synchronize with the application of the final
		dose of fertilizer. This helps to keep down the weeds.</p>

	<h2 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">
		Tying of cane</h2>
	<p>It is very desirable to tie up the canes so that they may not sway during the winds, and lodge. The best way to
		do the tying is to bring together the stalks from adjacent rows and tie them together with their own trash and
		old leaves. In many places cane is tied at two or three levels with twists of cane trash, the twistline going
		from one end of the row to the other; sometimes the stalks are further propped up with bamboos.</p>

	<h2 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">
		Plant protection</h2>
	<h2 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">
		Pest</h2>
	<h2 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">
		Termites</h2>
	Termites are attack planted sugarcane setts, usually from the cut ends or eyebuds, but in severe cases internode as
	well; after germination, the roots are attacked and pest ascends in the canes, eating all their contents and filling
	the galleries with earth; leaves dry up and the plants die; more active in sandy soils and in drier tracts.

	<h2 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">
		Control</h2>
	<p>Use only well-rotted manure, mix thoroughly 5% Aldrin or Chlordane dust with the soil; if the standing crop is
		attacked, apply Aldrin E.C. at 3kg a.i/ha diluted with 2,000 litres of water as near the roots as possible.
		Early shoot-borer
		Causing dead-hearts which can be easily pulled out; the maximum activity is observed during April to August;
		responsible for serious losses in tonnage and sugar recovery.

	<h2 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">
		Control</h2>
	<p>Practice cleans cultivation; plant healthy setts; give two light stage of the crop; avoid ratooning;
		systematically collect and destroy egg masses; remove dead-hearts and do deep harvesting.</p>

	<h2 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">
		Internode borer</h2>
	<p>Newly hatched caterpillars scrape the leaf spindle; later, they bore into the tender cane tops; the growing-point
		is damaged and results in a dead-heart; active from July till harvest; the pest causes more loss in tonnage than
		in juice quality.</p>

	<h2 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">
		Control</h2>
	Burn all trash after harvest; Practice clean cultivation; collect and destroy egg masses and larvae during early
	stages of crop.
	<h2 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">Disease</h2>
	<h2 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">
		Red rot</h2>
	<p>It is a fungal disease. The symptoms of the disease will appear when the crop is about six months old. At the
		initial stage, drying of top leaves can be seen. The leaf starts withering and drooping almost all shoots in a
		clump starts drying one by one. Red lesions with straw coloured centres develop on the midrib of leaves.</p>

	<h2 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">Control</h2>
	<p>Uproot and destroy all the clumps as soon as symptoms appear. Avoid ratooning. Use disease free and heat-treated
		setts for planting. After harvest, collect and burn the plant debris. Grow resistant varieties like CO-7706,
		CO-86032 and tolerant varieties are CO-8021 and CO-62175.</p>

	<h2 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">
		Grassy shoot disease</h2>
	<p>This disease is caused by Mycoplasma like organism and is severe on ratoon crop than on the main crop. Symptoms
		are stunting, profuse tillering and grass like growth of shoots (busy appearance) and yellowing of leaves with
		short internodes.</p>

	<h2 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">
		Control</h2>
	<p>Use disease free and heat-treated setts for planting. Uproot and destroy the infected clumps.<br>

		Avoid ratooning. Spray Endosulfan (0.2%) to kill insect vectors i.e., aphids which transmit the disease. Use
		resistant varieties like CO-7219, CO-740, CO-8014 and CO-8011.</p>

	<h2 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">
		Harvesting and yield</h2>
	<p>Assessing the maturity of the cane crop
		The maturity of sugarcane is generally recognized by the lower leaves gradually withering up and leaving
		progressively fewer green leaves at the top. <br>A ripe cane, out across with a sharp knife, shows against
		sunlight a slight sparkling in its flesh in contrast to the more watery cut surface of an unripe cane. If the
		grower can keep and use a hand sugar refractometer, the testing of maturity would be easier. <br>The hand
		refractometer reading of 20, the cane crop may be considered to have reached the stage of maturity. Small Mill
		Test (SMT) will be a real solution for this perennial problem. For conducting SMT, few canes (say about 10
		canes) have to be cut from the field and the samples are analyzed after crushing the cane in a small mill for
		poll, brix, purity and ccs% in the laboratory which clearly gives the maturity status of the cane.</p>

	<h2 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">
		Harvesting system and harvesting unit</h2>
	<p>The Cooperative generally begins the sugarcane harvest about the first of November and continues for an average
		of 150 days. The sugarcane harvest is timed and coordinated undertaking to allow for maximum utilization of the
		mill's grinding capacity.<br> At present the harvesting and supply of sugarcane is done by the farmers after
		receiving the cutting orders from the factory authorities. The cutting orders are issued depending upon the date
		of planting as found in the records and agreement between the farmers and factory. This system will not hold
		good, as uniform maturity of the cane crop can’t be controlled even by planting early maturing varieties in the
		early season.<br> In a typical harvesting unit, three or four harvesters operate in tandem with six to eight
		tractors and strings of wagons. The huge machines contain rotating knives, which cut the sugarcane at the base
		of the stalk. The cane tops are also cut off by rotating knives and the excess foliage is removed by giant
		extraction fans. <br>As the sugarcane passes through the harvester, it is cut into 12-inch lengths called
		billets and then put into in-field wagons. The sugarcane is then hauled to near-by transfer stations and loaded
		into semi-trailers for delivery.</p>

	<h2 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">
		Yield</h2>
	<p>The average yield of a 11 to 12 month-old plant crop under commercial cultivation is 100 tonnes per hectare in
		case of suru, 170 tonnes per hectare for Adsali and 120 tonnes per hectare in case of pre seasonal sugarcane.
