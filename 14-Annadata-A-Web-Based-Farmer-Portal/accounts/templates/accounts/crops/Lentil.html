    <h2 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">Soil</h2>

    <p>
        Lentil can be grown on all type of soil. Saline, Alkaline or waterlogged soils should be avoided. Soil should be
        friable and weed free so that seed could be placed at uniform depth.
    </p>


    <h2 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">Land preparation</h2>

    <p>

        In case of light soils, less tillage or soil manipulation is required to prepare seed-bed. One deep ploughing
        followed by 3-4 cross harrowingâ€™s should be given in case of heavy soils. 2-3 ploughings are sufficient for
        proper pulverization of land. Levelling of field should also be done for proper distribution of water. Proper
        moisture should be present in the field at the time of sowing seeds.
