<header><h1 style="color:DodgerBlue;">	Watershed Development Program</h1></header>

<p>
Considering the irrigation capacity of the state, most of the agriculture in the state is rainfed. The water conservation program is being implemented in the state through various schemes to create protected water irrigation facilities for this agriculture, to prevent massive erosion of land and to increase the means of income and production in rural areas by developing fallow lands. Until 1983, this program was seen only as a soil conservation program. Funds for this work were also being recovered from the farmers. Therefore, the scope of this program was very limited. However, considering the importance of this program, this program got a boost after the state government decided to implement this entire program at full government expense. After 1983, the government decided to make soil and water conservation a matter of watershed. Efforts were made from time to time to increase the effectiveness of the program by incorporating various departments and new treatments as required from time to time in the watershed program. Similar to the State Government, the Central Government has started Drought Prone Areas Program, Integrated Wasteland Development, National Watershed Development Program, River Basin Project, Western Ghats Development Program, Integrated Watershed Management Program etc. The government also took the initiative to implement the scheme. In order to implement the watershed program, efforts were made from time to time to make the program public by involving NGOs as well as various government departments.

<h2 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">Why select watershed area for overall development?</h2>




<br
<p>

Prior to the Watershed Development Program, soil conservation works were carried out on a single basis, in a scattered manner and in places where the consent of the farmers was obtained. Therefore, the benefits of this work were limited to a specific area.
As the catchment area is selected, various treatments are carried out according to the size and usability of the land and the land is properly conserved. Also, planning can be done by calculating how much rain falls in the catchment area, how much water will be available from it, how much water will be blocked in different places, how much water will be carried out. Therefore, various treatments can be done on the area to retain / absorb maximum amount of water in the soil.
Works are carried out on all the lands in the catchment area according to the slope as well as considering the water storage capacity.
Since the catchment area is selected, all the work of soil conservation and water conservation is done on this area. Since all these works are complementary to each other, their combined effect is definitely good
Various treatments in the upper reaches of the catchment area reduce the amount of sunshine, control the flow of water, recharge the groundwater in the lower reaches and increase the groundwater level. Also Nitrogen, Sporad and Palash etc. Food loss also stops.
<br>Watershed area can lead to development of entire area, all areas can become productive, increase productivity and achieve economic development.
<br>Watersheds help maintain ecological balance.
<br>Natural resources can be fully exploited.
<br>Watersheds provide a lot of employment.
<br>The loss of nutrients like nitrogen, spores and potassium which are useful to the crop is reduced.
<br>This program is also important from the point of view of health. If proper treatment is implemented to increase the productivity of land in tribal areas, the problem of malnutrition can be reduced to some extent by increasing productivity.

<p>Watershed development works are carried out by the Department of Soil and Water Conservation from various central and state fund sources. The details of those plans are as follows</p>
<h2 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;"> Center Reward Scheme:</h2>
<p> 1.Integrated Watershed Management Program (IWMP)
<br>2.Western Ghats Development Program (WGDP)
