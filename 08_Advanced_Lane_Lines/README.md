08_Road Lane Line Detection

Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) are being developed to assist the driver in their driving processes to reduce road accidents.
Car safety and road safety are thereby nowadays a most important issue. Human errors are prone to occur in the majority of road accidents on highways.
Not being Patient or attentive is one of the main factors for road accidents. ADAS provides the automated system to automate, enhance and adapt to the environment to reduce road fatalities and avoid collisions.
The system either alerts the driver or takes necessary actions of driving tasks providing necessary information like lane departure warning (LDW), the position of vehicles, road boundaries.
One of the scientific fields involved in these tasks includes computer vision that performs tasks automatically compared with human visual system tasks. Computer vision senses the environment and can be applied in many applications supported by intelligent vehicle systems (ITS).
Autonomous vehicles are a newer arena of computer vision ranging its level from fully autonomous vehicles to vehicles where a driver is supported by computer vision-based systems. Road boundaries and lane markings are the most perceptual cues for human driving.
The Lane Line detection may be a critical component for self-driving and cars generally and also for computer vision. Through this project, we will build a machine learning project to detect lane lines in real-time. We will do this using the concepts of computer vision using the OpenCV library and also use the programming language Python.
To detect the lane, we have to detect the white markings that are present on both sides of the lane. Using computer vision techniques in Python, we'll identify road lane lines during which autonomous cars must run.
This will be a critical part of autonomous cars, as self-driving cars should not cross their lane and should not go in the opposite or adjacent lanes to avoid accidents.
