# 04_A-Comprehensive-Blockchain-Based-Web-Framework-For-Blood-Banks
We aim to enhance the current blood supply chain management system by using a distributed ledger structure and transaction execution process of the situation where the collected blood arrives at the final stage - hospitals. The existing centralized blood management systems have various disadvantages like lack of data on blood bags and incapacity to reflect real-time updates in greater detail. Keeping these concerns in mind, we have implemented the blockchain in this project which offers the opportunity to maintain a transparent blood bank management system. It also ensures that the data cannot be falsified and tampered.
