Description:
Generally, a child, especially a newborn's, needs the utmost care and awareness of parents or elders. But at present, parents are very occupied with their work and hardly get time to look after their baby. This may lead to physical and mental stress for infants as well as their parents. In this paper, grouping of newbornâ€™s cry signals is done into five categories: hunger, discomfort, angry, tiredness and belly pain. The proposed system involves preprocessing the cry signal and finding the MFCC coefficients followed by feeding the recovered data into CNN for training and classification. Exploratory results show that the proposed method attains 74% perfection.
